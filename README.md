# Python Programming

A collection of Python exercises and projects covering fundamental programming concepts and data manipulation.

## Project Structure

###  Controlling Program Flow
Comprehensive exercises on control structures, loops, and conditionals:
- **Module 1**: Basic control flow exercises (8 exercises)
- **Module 2**: Intermediate control structures (3 exercises)
- **Module 3**: Advanced flow control (4 exercises)
- **Module 4**: Practical applications
- **Module 5**: Recursion (factorial, fibonacci)
- **Final Project**: Capstone exercises

### 💱 Currency Converter
A currency conversion application:
- `currency.py` - Currency data structures
- `exchangeit.py` - Exchange rate calculations
- `testcurrency.py` - Unit tests

### 📚 Mastering Data Structures
Deep dive into Python data structures:
- Lists, dictionaries, tuples
- Nested data structures
- Dictionary and tuple expansion
- Functions as parameters
- **Exercise 2**: Clock implementation
- **Exercise 3**: Advanced data structure operations
- **Exercise 4**: Practical applications

### 📊 Auditing Datasets
Working with different file formats and data processing:
- `csv_files.py` - CSV file handling and processing
- `json_files.py` - JSON data manipulation
- `text_files.py` - Text file operations

## Getting Started

Each module contains exercises with implementation files (`func.py` or `funcs.py`) and corresponding test files (`test.py` or `tests.py`).

To run tests for any exercise:
```bash
python path/to/test.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Learning Path

1. Start with **Controlling Program Flow** to master conditionals, loops, and program logic
2. Apply knowledge in the **Currency Converter** practical project
3. Deep dive into **Mastering Data Structures** for Python's core data types
4. Practice file handling with **Auditing Datasets**
